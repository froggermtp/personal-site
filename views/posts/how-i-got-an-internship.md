Not to brag or anything but I recently accepted an offer to intern at Paycom for the summer of 2019. So that nobody has to ask me: the internship has something to do with software development. I am anticipating working on a team to solve interesting problems. Yeah, I don’t really know exactly what I’ll be doing yet; however, I wanted to ramble a little bit about my process of trying to get an internship.

At the beginning of this fall semester, I was relatively clueless about the professional world. Coming in though, I set one goal — get an internship. I also at least knew a couple important details. One, my college’s job fair was during the fall semester. Two, most companies interview and make hiring decisions for summer positions during the fall. The lesson in all this is that if you want a summer internship, start early in the fall.

The job fair itself was just a few weeks into the semester, and I had to go purchase a suit. All of these professional events require people to like dress professionally. Thus, I ended up at a Macy’s with my mom. The people at Macy’s are very helpful. One of the store clerks helped me find a jacket and slacks that actually fit. I’ll skip the part about me clumsily trying on clothes and just say that a random shopper told me I looked great.

After investing in clothes, I had to write the all-important resume. At some school event, I had acquired a sample resume for engineering students. This sample resume became the template for my own achievements. Accordingly, I scribbled down stuff about my life, and honestly, it did not feel like I had done that much. I had worked a couple entry level jobs; neither had anything to do with computer science. I had flirted with some clubs, but I did not hold any leadership positions. After some introspection, I felt like a key to creating my resume was to focus on what I had achieved versus all the things that I hadn’t. Growing up, I was taught to be humble, but that can make it easy to overlook small victories. Yeah, I didn’t have any previous internship experience or lead a bunch of clubs, but I did volunteer regularly. I worked hard on my class projects and was proud of them. My unimportant entry level jobs were a big deal; I learned a lot of life lessons from them. Anyway, I created a resume.

As a quiet, introverted person, the job fair slightly terrified me. I had gone my freshman year just to look around, but this time I actually had to try. Before arriving, I searched through a list of companies that would be there. For the all the companies that had computer science related internships available, I visited their official website and took notes on my phone. The notes would later prove to not be very useful but it was the thought that counts. What really mattered is that I know which companies had internships. I also took care of other small but necessary things. For example, I taught myself how to tie a tie. Also, I printed out an entire stack of resumes. Then, I throw away all of the resumes (dang typos) and printed a new stack. Eventually, the day came. I got dressed in my suit, tied my tie, grabbed my resumes, and meandered over to the job fair.

The fair was crowded with well dressed people, who moved from here to there. Upon arriving, my strategy was simply to visit all of the company booths that I know had internships from my research session. Outside of the meta, there were a lot of unknowns. I knew that I enjoyed my classes. Growing up, I loved tinkering with computers. However, I honestly didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do in the context of a career. I figured that the only way I would know if I actually liked doing something was to do the something. Of course, all of this meant I had to step out of my comfort zone. Thus, I visited lots of booths and had no clue if I was doing a good job. Metaphorically, I was Russell Westbrook. I was going to keep shooting even when I was bricking everything; only, instead of shooting, I was handing out resumes.

From business cards and pamphlets, I was bestowed instructions for how to sign up for interviews. Every company had a slightly different process. It usually involved having to fill out an online form. There is nothing fun about filling out online forms, but I typed and retyped my info nonetheless. Eventually, I got accepted for some interviews, but I also got plenty of rejections. As the interview requests trickled in, I found time to squeeze in some preparation. My first on-campus interview wasn’t my first interview, but it was different from my other interview experiences. It also didn’t go very well. My interviewer was kind through my stumbling performance and encouraged me practice. Thus, I practiced some more. Each interview, I did better, slowly picking up on various nuances. Eventually, I did interview with Paycom a couple of times, and they extended an offer. I was able to utilize all the lessons I learned from my past failures and now get to do something exciting this summer.
