Scroll, scroll, scroll. I was taking a break today by mindlessly perusing Twitter. For those who use Twitter, you would know that most tweets are trash. I stumbled upon [this tweet](https://twitter.com/theboncenter/status/1219519726621200384?s=20) which was not trash. It's apparently a long lost letter from Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Who is Bonhoeffer? He's a well-known German pastor and theologian. I only know who is because I took a class in college about Jesus, and we were all forced to read some of his stuff. Hey, it was a fun class, and the Bonhoeffer material resonated with me. For this post, I don't want to spend a lot of time summarizing Bonhoeffer's life. There's plenty of other sources elsewhere on the Internet. I instead want to briefly examine this letter.

Here, Bonhoeffer is writing to Gandhi. I wrote that last sentence like it's a normal thing to just wake up and write to Gandhi. The letter begins with Bonhoeffer describing why he's writing: "It is on account of the most distressing situation in the European countries and my own country." For those out of the loop, this letter was written in 1934â€”Hitler was running the show in Germany in 1934. Things were bad in Germany. Things were especially bad in the church. Separation of church and state was not taken seriously, and most churches were defacto Nazi propaganda machines. 

To say the least, Bonhoeffer did not like what the church was doing. He wanted change, but he wanted that change to be deep and lasting. He proposed that "the great need of Europe and of Germany in particular is not the economic and political confusion, but it is a deep spiritual need." This desire for a spiritual awakening undergirds the entire letter. Bonhoeffer seems to think that Gandhi might have the key to the door. This is interesting because Gandhi is not a Christian. But as Bonhoeffer explains: "the people whose faith Jesus praised mostly did not belong to the official Church at that time either." So who does belong to the church? Is Gandhi a part of the church?

Bonhoeffer not only seems to think Gandhi is in the church, but he also has something important to impart. Gandhi "realizes his faith." This faith isn't only some abstract, intellectual foothold on God, it drives action. The correct beliefs did not have to be ascended to. Gandhi didn't cross his t's and dot his i's. He lived "a life devoted to political and racial peace." As Germany prepared to go war with Europe, Bonhoeffer wanted peace. He wanted to see the principles Jesus laid out at the Sermon on the Mount lived out. Gandhi seemed to want the same things.

Now, I don't feel qualified to say whether Bohoeffer's perspective is right or wrong; however, I do think that we should be the hands of Jesus and try to bend the world back into shape. Injustice is everywhere. Many good deeds only exist as thoughts. There is a lot of work to be done and not enough workers to fill the quota. But God is big and powerful and merciful and loving and on our team.
