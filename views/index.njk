    <h2>I'm Matthew Parris, a computer science student at The University of Tulsa</h2>
    <p>
        I want to make the world a better placeâ€”by utilizing science,
        technology, engineering, and math as well as an audicious amount
        of em dashes. In middle school, I got into making some really 
        terrible video games. Now, I code corporate applications ðŸŽ‰. It's
        some serious stuff. Some of the buzzwords that I am currently into:
        Javascript, Node JS, Puppeteer, browser automation, and 
        single-page applications.
