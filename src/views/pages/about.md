Hello! If you're looking for the British politician, you've made a wrong turn. I'm Matthew Parris, a DevOps software engineer from Oklahoma—where the wind, as they say, comes sweepin' down the plain.

By day, I build and maintain systems at Paycom. On this site, I enjoy diving deep into technical topics and sharing what I'm learning along the way.

I'm also a Christian, a fact I sometimes explore here. My faith is a core part of who I am. If that's not your cup of tea, feel free to scroll on by.

I maintain a love-hate relationship with running, a hobby I picked up in high school and have kept up ever since. You won't catch me running on a holiday—some lines must be drawn.

This site is evolving. Instead of a traditional blog, it's becoming my personal collection of notes, links, and internet riffraff. Think of it as my digital garden, which I'll be tending to more in the near future.

The best way to reach me is by email. I'm not very active on social media. For secure communication, just ask.
